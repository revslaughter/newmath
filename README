So this is the idea, as put forth by Conrad Wolfram and modified by me:


Here's why we teach math:

1) See a real-world problem and formulate a question
	- question must have some kind of answerable structure
	- question must make sense logically, determine whether it is
	  possible to find a solution

2) Formulate a mathematical model
	- model must be pulled from a resource of taught models
		- statistical
		- algebraic
		- calculus
		- set/group theory
	- model must have some kind of solution or make some kind of prediction
		- In other words, programmable
		- students must be able to utilize taught models to program
		  the solution to the problem

3) Solution must be calculated
	- Run the program

4) Apply calculated solution
	- determine logically whether the situation is satisfied
	- determine any error and if there is a more appropriate solution
	  or if the solution found could be optimized in the future

What do kids want when they're being taught math?

	- They want to answer, "When will I ever USE this?"
		- It's easy to see how we use history, it colors the world
		  around us and forms our opinions about the world. Same with
		  science, it tells us something about the world and gives us something
		  to relate to.
		- It's difficult to see how kids will use 'calculation-based' arithmetic
		  that's taught today, especially when in the real world computers take
		  care of calculation. We need instead to teach kids basic applied math
		  using computers for waht they're meant for.

	- They want to be challenged academically
		- Student apathy is always a problem for any subject. However it
		  runs high and deep for mathematics. Why is this different? Every person
		  has the capacity for logical thinking, but in the end we graduate
